# **About Me**

Hi! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :raising_hand:,<br>

I have worked in the digital media industry in tasks such as **web design** and image and video editing. Also, I have experience as an academic researcher, focusing mainly on areas related to **augmented reality** and **machine learning**, among others, like computer graphics, computer vision, and image processing.

My interests cover from interface design, focusing on **UI/UX**, to web and mobile applications. Without leaving aside the back-end development. I think that having an understanding of how the full-stack is composed, the whole development process is more fluent. My goal is to become a full-stack developer!

I consider myself a **creative**, committed, and responsible person. Iâ€™m an enthusiast of self-learning, and I feel excited in front of big **new challenges**.
