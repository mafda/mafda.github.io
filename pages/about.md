# **About Me**

:raising_hand: Hi! I am **maría fernanda rodríguez r.**

I am a motivated professional with over ten years of experience in front-end development and research. Currently, I am working as a data scientist.

In the beginning of my professional career, I worked in the digital media industry for about 3 years, primarily focusing on tasks such as interface design, UI/UX, web development, and more recently, mobile applications, as well as back-end development. I believe that understanding the full-stack composition enhances the overall fluency of the entire development process.

Throughout my postgraduate studies, I acquired experience as an academic researcher, with a primary focus on areas related to augmented reality and machine learning. Additionally, I have expertise in fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, image processing, and human-computer interaction.

At present, I hold a position as a data scientist, where my focus lies in expanding my expertise in machine learning systems, data science, and big data technologies.

I see myself as a creative, dedicated, and accountable individual. I’m passionate about self-driven learning and thrive on embracing substantial challenges, as I believe they offer the most valuable opportunities for personal and professional development.

I have a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. In my view, information technologies possess immense potential to address challenges and significantly impact everyone's lives. Being actively involved in this transformative process is incredibly exhilarating.
