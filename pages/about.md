# **About Me**

Hi! I am **maría fernanda rodríguez r**. :raising_hand:

I am a driven professional with over ten years of experience in
**front-end development**, **research**, and recently as a **data scientist**.

I have worked in the digital media industry on tasks ranging from interface design,
focusing on UI/UX, to web and mobile applications. Without leaving aside the
back-end development. I think that having an understanding of how the full-stack
is composed, the whole development process is more fluent.

Also, I have experience as an academic researcher, focusing mainly on areas
related to augmented reality and machine learning, among others, like computer
graphics, computer vision, image processing, and human-computer interaction.

I consider myself a creative, committed, and responsible person. I am an enthusiast
of self-learning, and I feel excited in front of new big challenges. I think they
are the best way to grow in any area.

I like technology, and I am passionate about solutions. From my perspective,
information technologies have enormous potential to solve problems and have a
huge impact on everyone's life. Being part of this process is just exciting.

Currently, I am studying **MLOps** and **Kubernetes** :rocket:
