# **About Me**

:raising_hand: Hi! I am **maría fernanda rodríguez r.**

I am a driven professional with over ten years of experience in
**front-end development**, **research**, and recently I am working as a
**data scientist**.

I have worked in the digital media industry on tasks ranging from interface design,
focusing on UI/UX, to web and mobile applications, as well as back-end development.
I think by having an understanding of how the full-stack is composed, the whole
development process becomes more fluent.

Also, I have experience as an academic researcher, focusing mainly on areas
related to augmented reality and machine learning, among others, such as computer
graphics, computer vision, image processing, and human-computer interaction.

I consider myself to be a creative, committed, and responsible person. I am an
enthusiastic self-learner, and I feel excited by big new challenges. I think they
are the best way to grow in any area.

I like technology, and I am passionate about solutions. From my perspective,
information technologies have enormous potential to solve problems and have a
huge impact on everyone's life. Being part of this process is exciting.

Currently, I am studying **MLOps** and **Kubernetes** :rocket:
